# aerogardenPi
This project is for folks who have an Aerogarden with dead electronics that they want to revive and continue to use.  Physically, the Aerogarden is well constructed and much more durrable than it's electronic components, gotta love engineered obselesence!  Seriously, who thought putting all the guts UNDER the water tank was a good idea?

As of 2/2023 this is still a work in progress.  Below is the list of things that have yet to be done, but if you're clever you can hack something together using what's here already.

To Do:
* Add physical diagram of the components
* Add photos
* Add list of features
* Add internal documentation to the python, php and html files to allow for customization
* Add basic instructions on how to use the damn thing

If anyone sees something in the code that could be improved (and I'm sure there's LOTS that could be) please submit a pull request for review.

If you're going to use any of my work in your own project, and you plan on distributing it, please make sure to link back to this repo as a source.  It's just the courteous thing to do.  Don't be that guy.
